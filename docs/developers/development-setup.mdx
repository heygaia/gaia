## Who This Guide Is For

This development setup guide is designed for:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open Source Contributors" icon="git-alt">
    Developers who want to contribute to the GAIA project by fixing bugs, adding
    features, or improving documentation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customizers" icon="wrench">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Docker & Docker Compose">
    - Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
    - Docker Compose
    - At least 4GB of available RAM
    - 10GB of free disk space
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Development Tools">
    - Git (for version control)
    - Python 3.11+ (for backend development)
    - Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
    - pnpm (for frontend package management)
    - uv (for Python package management)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="System Requirements">
    - macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
    - At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
    - SSD storage for better performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Environment Setup

To start developing on GAIA, you need to set up your local environment. You can choose between an automated setup using our script or a manual setup.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automated Setup" icon="rocket">
    We provide a script that automates the entire setup process. This is the recommended method for most users.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
        First, copy the example environment files and configure them:

        ```bash
        cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
        cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
        ```

        Then configure your environment variables by following the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).

      </Step>
      <Step title="Run the Setup Script">
        Open your terminal and run the following command from the project root:

        ```bash
        ./scripts/setup.sh
        ```

        This script will:
        - Start all Docker services
        - Create a Python virtual environment.
        - Install backend dependencies with `uv`.
        - Install frontend dependencies with `pnpm`.

      </Step>
      <Step title="You're Ready!">
        Your development environment is now ready to go!
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Setup" icon="wrench">
    If you prefer to set up your environment manually, follow these steps.

### Environment Variables

Before you start the services, you need to configure your environment variables. GAIA uses `.env` files to manage these settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Example Files">
    We provide example files to get you started. Copy them to create your own `.env` files:

    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Your Secrets">
    Edit the newly created `.env` files and fill in your API keys and other secrets.

    For a detailed explanation of all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Docker Services">
    GAIA relies on several services that run in Docker containers. You have two options:

    **Option 1: Start all services (including frontend in Docker)**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    **Option 2: Start only backend services (recommended for development)**
    ```bash
    docker compose --profile backend-only up -d
    ```

    <Note>
      **Why use backend-only profile?**

      Running the frontend in Docker can introduce slight latency and slower hot reloading. For the best development experience, we recommend using the `backend-only` profile and running the frontend manually with `pnpm dev` (see Frontend Setup below).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Virtual Environment">
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Backend Dependencies">
    We use `uv` for fast dependency management. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Frontend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Frontend Directory">
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Frontend Dependencies">
    We use `pnpm` for managing frontend packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Development Server (Recommended)">
    For the best development experience with fast hot reloading, run the frontend manually:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000` with optimized hot reloading.

    <Tip>
      **Performance Tip:** Running the frontend outside Docker provides faster hot reloading and better performance during development. The frontend will automatically connect to the backend services running in Docker.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Root Directory">
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

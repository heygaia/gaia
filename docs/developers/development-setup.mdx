## Development Environment Setup

To start developing on GAIA, you need to set up your local environment. You can choose between an automated setup using our script or a manual setup.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automated Setup" icon="rocket" href="#automated-setup">
    The easiest way to get started. Our script handles everything for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Setup" icon="wrench" href="#manual-setup">
    For those who want more control over the setup process.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Automated Setup

We provide a script that automates the entire setup process. This is the recommended method for most users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Setup Script">
    Open your terminal and run the following command from the project root:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup.sh
    ```

    This script will:
    - Copy environment configuration files from examples (`.env.example` â†’ `.env`).
    - Start the required services with Docker Compose.
    - Create a Python virtual environment.
    - Install backend dependencies with `uv`.
    - Install frontend dependencies with `pnpm`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    After the script completes, you'll need to configure your environment variables:

    <Note>
      The script creates `.env` files from examples, but you need to add your API keys and secrets.
    </Note>

    Edit the created configuration files:
    - `backend/.env` - Add your API keys (OpenAI, Google OAuth, etc.)
    - `frontend/.env` - Configure API URLs and tokens

    For detailed configuration instructions, see:
    - [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables)
    - [Infisical Setup Guide](/configuration/infisical-setup) (recommended for production)

  </Step>
  <Step title="You're Ready!">
    Once you've configured your environment variables, your development environment is ready to go!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up your environment manually, follow these steps.

### Environment Variables

Before you start the services, you need to configure your environment variables. GAIA uses `.env` files to manage these settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Example Files">
    We provide example files to get you started. Copy them to create your own `.env` files:

    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Your Secrets">
    Edit the newly created `.env` files and fill in your API keys and other secrets.

    For a detailed explanation of all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Docker Services">
    GAIA relies on several services that run in Docker containers. You have two options:

    **Option 1: Start all services (including frontend in Docker)**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    **Option 2: Start only backend services (recommended for development)**
    ```bash
    docker compose --profile backend-only up -d
    ```

    <Note>
      **Why use backend-only profile?**

      Running the frontend in Docker can introduce slight latency and slower hot reloading. For the best development experience, we recommend using the `backend-only` profile and running the frontend manually with `pnpm dev` (see Frontend Setup below).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Virtual Environment">
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Backend Dependencies">
    We use `uv` for fast dependency management. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Frontend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Frontend Directory">
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Frontend Dependencies">
    We use `pnpm` for managing frontend packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Development Server (Recommended)">
    For the best development experience with fast hot reloading, run the frontend manually:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000` with optimized hot reloading.

    <Tip>
      **Performance Tip:** Running the frontend outside Docker provides faster hot reloading and better performance during development. The frontend will automatically connect to the backend services running in Docker.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Root Directory">
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running the Development Environment

After completing the setup, here's how to start your development environment:

### Recommended Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Backend Services">
    Start only the backend services and databases using the backend-only profile:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile backend-only up -d
    ```

    This starts:
    - **gaia-backend** - FastAPI application (port 8000)
    - **postgres** - Database (port 5432)
    - **redis** - Cache & sessions (port 6379)
    - **mongo** - Document storage (port 27017)
    - **chromadb** - Vector database (port 8080)
    - **rabbitmq** - Message queue (port 5672, management UI on 15672)
    - **arq_worker** - Background task worker
    - **worker** - Scheduler worker

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Frontend Development Server">
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with optimized hot reloading.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
    - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
    - **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
    - **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (admin/admin)
    - **Mongo Express**: http://localhost:8081 (admin/password)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Alternative: Full Docker Setup

If you prefer to run everything in Docker (including the frontend):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

<Warning>
  **Performance Note:** This approach may result in slower hot reloading for
  frontend development compared to running the frontend manually with `pnpm
  dev`.
</Warning>

### Stopping Services

To stop all running Docker services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop and remove all data (reset everything):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

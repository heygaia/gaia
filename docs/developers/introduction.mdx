## Key Technologies

GAIA is built with modern technologies that make development efficient and scalable:

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API development
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React/TypeScript) for modern web application development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with MongoDB for different data types
- **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB for AI embeddings and semantic search
- **Caching**: Redis for fast data access and session management
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous task processing
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment

## Quick Commands

Once your environment is set up, these commands will help you develop efficiently:

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up

# Run backend in development mode
cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run frontend in development mode
cd frontend && pnpm dev

# Run tests
cd backend && uv run pytest
cd frontend && pnpm test
```

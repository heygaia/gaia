// Tool Registry
// Single source of truth for tool names and their data payload types.
// When you add a tool here, all downstream types (ToolName, ToolDataMap),
// message schemas, and UI renderers can infer the correct types automatically.
//
// Why `null as unknown as T`?
// - We want a value-level object (used at runtime for deriving keys) that also
//   carries precise compile-time types for each key.
// - Using `null` keeps runtime cost at zero; these values are never read.
// - Casting `null as unknown as T` tells TypeScript: “treat this value as T”
//   without needing to construct a real instance of T. The first cast to
//   `unknown` is required to legally cast from `null` to any specific type.
// - Result: strong static typing with no runtime overhead and a single place to
//   author tool types.
//
// Single source of truth
// - `TOOL_REGISTRY` defines all tool keys and their payload shapes.
// - `ToolName` is derived from its keys.
// - `ToolDataMap` maps each key to its payload type.
// - `TOOLS_MESSAGE_SCHEMA` (below) composes tool data into message schemas.
// - UI components (like renderers) can key off `ToolName` and get the exact
//   payload type for each tool.
//
// How to add a new tool
// 1) Add a new key here with its payload type using `null as unknown as YourType`.
// 2) If you have a renderer, register it in your renderer map keyed by the new tool name.
// 3) If you stream or store this tool’s data in messages, no extra typing is required;
//    the message schema derives from this registry.
// 4) Optionally, add tests and docs/examples demonstrating the new tool.

    Analyze conversation context and suggest relevant follow-up actions.

    PROBLEM SOLVED:
    ==============
    LangGraph was automatically streaming our follow-up actions LLM call along with
    the main agent response, causing unwanted mixed output. We needed the follow-up
    actions to be generated silently and streamed separately with controlled timing.

    THREADING SOLUTION:
    ==================
    Using run_in_executor() executes the LLM call in an isolated thread where
    LangGraph cannot detect it. This prevents automatic streaming while allowing
    us to manually stream the results when we want using get_stream_writer().

    The key insight: LangGraph only monitors LLM calls in the main async thread context.
    Thread pool workers are invisible to this monitoring system.

        state: The current state of the conversation

    Returns:
        Empty dict indicating successful completion (follow-up actions are streamed, not stored in state)

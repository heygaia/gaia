        """Retrieve tools to use based on exact tool names or semantic search queries.

        This is your primary tool discovery mechanism. Use this function to find the specific tools
        you need for any task. You must provide either exact_tool_names OR query (or both).

        EXACT TOOL NAMES (PRIMARY METHOD):
        Use this when you know the exact tool name from the system prompt or previous context.
        This is the most direct and reliable method when you're certain of the tool name.

        SEMANTIC SEARCH (FALLBACK METHOD):
        Use natural language queries to describe what you want to accomplish when you don't know
        the exact tool names. The system uses vector similarity to find the most relevant tools
        based on your intent.

        Semantic Query Guidelines:
        • Analyze user's intent: "What is the user trying to accomplish?"
        • Use descriptive, action-oriented queries: "send email", "create calendar event", "search contacts"
        • Try category + action format: "gmail send", "notion create", "twitter post", "calendar view"
        • Use synonyms and related terms if first attempt doesn't work
        • Don't hesitate to call this function multiple times for different functionalities
        • Be persistent - if you know a tool should exist, try different query variations

        Suggested query patterns:
        • Email: "mail send", "gmail compose", "email draft", "contact search"
        • Calendar: "calendar create", "schedule event", "calendar view", "meeting search"
        • Todos: "todo create", "task update", "todo delete", "task search"
        • Notion: "notion create page", "notion database", "notion search", "workspace manage"
        • Twitter: "twitter post", "social media", "tweet create", "twitter search"
        • LinkedIn: "linkedin post", "professional network", "career content"
        • Research: "web search", "deep research", "fetch webpage"
        • Documents: "google docs", "document create", "file generate"
        • Code: "execute code", "run script", "code sandbox"
        • Weather: "weather check", "current weather"
        • Images: "generate image", "create visual"
        • Flowcharts: "create flowchart", "diagram generate"

        Args:
            query: Natural language description of what you want to accomplish.
                   Use when you don't know exact tool names. Use descriptive terms and try
                   different phrasings if initial search fails. Can be empty if using exact_tool_names.
            exclude_tools: List of tool names to exclude from results.
            exact_tool_names: List of EXACT tool names to include directly in results.
                             Use when you know the exact tool name from system prompt STRICTLY.
                             Examples:
                             - "GMAIL_SEND_DRAFT", "GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT"
                             - "NOTION_CREATE_DATABASE", "NOTION_ADD_PAGE_CONTENT"
                             - "TWITTER_CREATION_OF_A_POST", "TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP_ME"

        Returns:
            List of tool names that match the search criteria.

        Usage Examples:
        • retrieve_tools(exact_tool_names=["GMAIL_SEND_DRAFT"]) - Get specific tool when you know the name
        • retrieve_tools(query="send email") - Find email sending tools when you don't know exact names
        • retrieve_tools(exact_tool_names=["NOTION_SPECIFIC_TOOL"], query="notion database") - Combine both

        Workflow Strategy:
        1. Start with exact_tool_names if you know the precise tool names from system prompt
        2. Fallback to semantic queries when you don't know exact names
        3. Try multiple query variations if first semantic attempt doesn't find expected tools
        4. Retrieve ALL necessary tools before starting task execution
        5. Call this function multiple times for different tool categories as needed
